    &nbsp &nbsp   Atatürk's talk about aviation
    While Türkkuşu started his studies, it was said at Etimesgut airport:

Ladies and gentlemen!

Our world - you can - is made up of earth, water and air. These are the basic elements of life, aren't they? The lack of one of these elements not only the lack, but only the disorder makes life impossible.

It should increase the interest of the life, especially the national life, to protect it, to the lands and seas of its homeland, as well as to its air every day.

This relevance happens with sovereignty to the life organizations I count.</br>


He derived natural people and worshiped them. However, it also made them necessary for their sovereignty in the world to be able to live in the world. Creatures who did not know how to dominate the nature could not protect their existence. Nature did not hesitate to crush, suffocate, destroy and destroy them within its own elements.

By demonstrating the capacity to recognize this great truth, Turks have opened up cultural ways that gave amplitude to humanity in a wide range of lands, leaving the waves untouched in large seas by making the soil and its products productive to humanity.However, in this age we live, people are no longer left alone on land and in the sea. They plunged into the air presence of nature.

It was understood the air for life, the insufficiency of breathing alone. It turned out that the necessary and real air domination was lean.

In this direction that all nations are working on with great fertility, the Turkish nation should have taken its place without a doubt.</br>

The Government of the Republic of Turkey, the land next to our army, while setting up our fleet in our air fleet, has not held back from launching the latest weather conditions.

Our air officers and commanders, whom we are honored with, are also trained. Our pilots are always at high value to bleach the face of the nation.

But friends, it would not be correct to see this much enough. It was necessary to include the air business according to the degree of importance it received worldwide.

Taking this into account, the Republican Government decided to make aviation the function of the whole nation.</br>

The Turks should be able to navigate in the mountains, forests, plains, seas, in every part of the country, in the same way, with the knowledge and confidence they walk, and in the skies of the country. This begins with accustoming Turkish to the race with their homeland birds in their homeland.

Here, the reason that gathered us here today is that holy commencement ceremony.</br>

Due to the actual winding kınav Aviation, Government, Mr. Chief of Staff Air Marshal and Turkey Authority Chairman Fuat valuable friend, here, I offer my special thanks.

I would be pleased to thank our friend Russian Soviet Republic and her Ambassador Mr. Karahan, who did not withhold their valuable help in achieving this task.
</br>
Turkish boy!
</br>
As in any job, in aviation, you will fill the place waiting for you at the highest level in a short time.

From this, our true friends will be happy and the Turkish nation will be happy. <br>

Ulus 4.05. 1935
